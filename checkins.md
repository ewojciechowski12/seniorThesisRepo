## Week 1 Summary (09/22/2025)

### This week I worked on:

1. Ordered microcontrollers, accelerometer and additional accessories.
2. Setup development environment (Arduino IDE).
3. Ran some sample projects to understand Arduino syntax and how to interface with GPIO pins on the ESP32.

### This week I learned:

1. How to flash the microcontroller with code developed in the Arduino IDE
2. How to interface with GPIO pins
3. How to print data from pins to the console
4. The different Arduino libraries I can use.

### My successes this week were:

1. Running code on the microcontroller   

### The challenges I faced this week were:

1. Setting up Arduino IDE
2. Reading data from GPIO pins

## Week 2 Summary (09/22/2025)
### This week I worked on:

Connecting the accelerometer to the microcontroller. I successfully accessed the accelerometer’s internal registers and displayed real-time data through the serial console in the Arduino IDE.

### This week I learned:

I learned that the accelerometer stores 2 bytes of data per axis in sequential registers. I also learned how to access these registers and correctly format the bits in my code to interpret the raw data as readable numbers.

### My successes this week were:

Successfully establishing communication between the accelerometer and the microcontroller and reading live sensor data.

### The challenges I faced this week were:

Accessing the data from the accelerometer’s registers was initially difficult since I hadn’t worked with these technologies before. After studying the accelerometer’s documentation and the I²C library, I was able to understand the communication process and extract the correct data.
